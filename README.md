# Rock-Paper-Scissors
The goal of this first javascript project was to create a rock paper scissors game.
This game had to include a player selection a computer selection and a way to decide who won each round as well as the game.
This project has taken a lot of learning to get accomplished but I am certainly better off for it. I would have had more commits had I worked through the project at a smoother pace but I often found myself deleting and changing the code almost every few minutes.
This project has tought me a insane amount and really made me feel a lot more comfortable writing code except I still need to work on problem solving and the proper way to look things up when im stuck.
At the time of writing this I have only gotten the console version done however im very excited for the full app to be complete!
